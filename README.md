# A Curricular Map of Data Science

## Overview
* See Google Doc (TBW)
* Based on corpus of course descriptions

## Goals
* Create an interactive visualization that allows
the comparison of each school's curriculum to a composite of all
curricula.
* Use topic models in combination with traditional classification

## Guidelines
* Classifications are variable. In particular, hierarchies are always negotiable; 
the reality is a network (rhizome).
* What's "real" are the terminal nodes 

## Deliverables
* Database
    * Basic stats:
        * Schools
        * Number of courses per school
    * Top keywords from manual tagging
    * Taxonomy of keywords  
* Processed Corpus
    * Top Bigrams from corpus
* Topic Model
    * Topic List
    * Heatmap (using schools as labels)
    * Topics named and classifed
    * Top phrases

## Resources
* Polo Topic Model
    * See polo files
* MySQL database of courses

    * Contaxins tables for INSTITUTION and COURSE
