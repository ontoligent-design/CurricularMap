This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The course focuses mainly on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in statistics, machine learning, AI, computer vision and robotics.

This course aims to provide a set of building blocks by which one can construct a complete architecture for storing and processing data. The course will examine how technical architectures vary depending on the problem to be solved and the reliability and freshness of the result. The course considers the complete breadth of technology choices. The content spans from traditional databases and business warehouse architectures, so-called big-data architectures, to streaming analytics solutions and graph processing. Students will consider both small and large datasets because both are equally important and both justify different trade-offs. Exercises and examples will consider both simple and complex data structures, as well as data that is both clean and structured and dirty and unstructured.

They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions. This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity. The class will include programming assignments, and a one-month short project chosen by the student.

This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you’ll need to do so.   The techniques you’ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and manycore shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others.

During the project, students engage in the entire process of solving a real-world data science project: from collecting and processing actual data, to applying a suitable and appropriate analytic method to the problem. Both the problem statements for the project assignments and the datasets orginate from real-world domains similar to those that students might typically encounter within industry, government, NGO, or academic research. Depending upon a project’s complexity, students work individually or in small teams on a problem statement typically specified by an industry or governmental sponsor employing data set provided by the sponsor. Academic, governmental and NGO research groups (both from within, as well as external to NYU) may also propose projects. A list of projects will be posted early in the semester, so students can align themselves with problems statements corresponding to their individual interests. As the project and problem statements warrant, students may be permitted to organize into teams of two to three participants. Teams larger than three will be considered for approval on a case-by-case basis, as warranted. The final problem statements and the composition of the teams will be approved by the Course Director in coordination with any relevant faculty advisor and the sponsor’s assigned representative (i.e. the sponsoring Project Coach). Each project team will be supervised by the Course Director (in some cases with a relevant faculty advisor) and advised by the Project Coach assigned from the academic, governmental, NGO or industry sponsor. Here are two examples of illustrative projects:  An large insurance company has an anonymized dataset of workers compensation claimants. The insurance claims dataset incorporates corresponding data, e.g. claimant demographics, claims payments, etc. A team comprised of capstone students, advised by the instructor in conjunction with a technical coach from the company, employ the dataset to develop and implement an analytic solution using software tools studied in previous courses. A professor from the Department of Politics has a dataset about tweets from individuals, with some indication of the party affiliation of the individual. Students use text classification methods studied in class to build a system that can predict party affiliation and voting behavior from tweets in conjunction social network tools to sort tweeters. Students will demonstrate an ability to handle a problem in data science from the point of problem definition through delivery of a solution. In doing so, they will demonstrate proficiency in collecting and processing real-world data, in designing the best methods to solve the problem, and in implementing a solution. Students will demonstrate competence in presenting material by delivering two presentations: a proposal on how to approach the problem and their final solution. Students will learn how to work in small teams by working with at least one other student on their project. Students will write a report on their project for evaluation by the instructor in consultation with the project advisors. The report will be structured as a typical research paper, and hence will include three main sections: 1. motivation and problem definition, existing approaches to the problem; 2. proposed solution; 3. results, conclusion, and directions for future work."
